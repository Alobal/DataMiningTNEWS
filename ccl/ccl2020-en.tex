  This document contains the instructions for preparing a paper submitted
  to CCL-2020 or accepted for publication in its proceedings. The document itself
  conforms to its own specifications, and is therefore an example of
  what your manuscript should look like. These instructions should be
  used for both papers submitted for review and for final versions of
  accepted papers. Authors are asked to conform to all the directions
  reported in this document.

    \noindent Published under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License
}

The following instructions are directed to authors of papers submitted
to CCL-2020 or accepted for publication in its proceedings. All
authors are required to adhere to these specifications. Authors are
required to provide a Portable Document Format (PDF) version of their
papers. \textbf{The proceedings are designed for printing on A4 paper.}

We may make additional instructions available at \url{http://www.cips-cl.org/}. Please check
this website regularly.

Manuscripts must be in single-column format. {\bf Type single-spaced.}  Start all
pages directly under the top margin. See the guidelines later
regarding formatting the first page. The lengths of manuscripts
should not exceed the maximum page limit described in Section~\ref{sec:length}.
Do not number the pages.


\subsection{Electronically-available Resources}

We strongly prefer that you prepare your PDF files using \LaTeX{} with
the official CCL 2020 style file (ccl2020-en.sty) and bibliography style
(ccl.bst). These files are available in ccl2020.zip at \url{http://www.cips-cl.org/}.
You will also find the document you are currently reading (ccl2020-en.pdf) and its \LaTeX{} source code
(ccl2020-en.tex) in ccl2020.zip. 


\subsection{Format of Electronic Manuscript}
\label{sect:pdf}

For the production of the electronic manuscript you must use Adobe's
Portable Document Format (PDF). PDF files are usually produced from
\LaTeX{} using the \textit{pdflatex} command. If your version of
\LaTeX{} produces Postscript files, you can convert these into PDF
using \textit{ps2pdf} or \textit{dvipdf}. On Windows, you can also use
Adobe Distiller to generate PDF.

Please make sure that your PDF file includes all the necessary fonts
(especially tree diagrams, symbols, and fonts for non-Latin characters). 
When you print or create the PDF file, there is usually
an option in your printer setup to include none, all or just
non-standard fonts.  Please make sure that you select the option of
including ALL the fonts. \textbf{Before sending it, test your PDF by
  printing it from a computer different from the one where it was
  created.} Moreover, some word processors may generate very large PDF
files, where each page is rendered as an image. Such images may
reproduce poorly. In this case, try alternative ways to obtain the
PDF. One way on some systems is to install a driver for a postscript
printer, send your document to the printer specifying ``Output to a
file'', then convert the file to PDF.

It is of utmost importance to specify the \textbf{A4 format} (21 cm
x 29.7 cm) when formatting the paper. When working with
{\tt dvips}, for instance, one should specify {\tt -t a4}.

If you cannot meet the above requirements for the
production of your electronic submission, please contact the
publication co-chairs as soon as possible.


\subsection{Layout}
\label{ssec:layout}

Format manuscripts with a single column to a page, in the manner these
instructions are formatted. The exact dimensions for a page on A4
paper are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Left and right margins: 2.5 cm
\item Top margin: 2.5 cm
\item Bottom margin: 2.5 cm
\item Width: 16.0 cm
\item Height: 24.7 cm
\end{itemize}

\noindent Papers should not be submitted on any other paper size.
If you cannot meet the above requirements for
the production of your electronic submission, please contact the
publication co-chairs above as soon as possible.


\subsection{Fonts}

For reasons of uniformity, Adobe's {\bf Times Roman} font should be
used. In \LaTeX2e{} this is accomplished by putting

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{times}
\usepackage{latexsym}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
in the preamble. If Times Roman is unavailable, use {\bf Computer
  Modern Roman} (\LaTeX2e{}'s default).  Note that the latter is about
  10\% less dense than Adobe's Times Roman font.

\begin{tabular}{|l|rl|}
\hline \bf Type of Text & \bf Font Size & \bf Style \\ \hline

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{font-table} Font guide. }
\end{table}

\subsection{The First Page}
\label{ssec:first}

Centre the title, author's name(s) and affiliation(s) across
the page.
Do not use footnotes for affiliations. Do not include the
paper ID number assigned during the submission process. 
Do not include the authors' names or affiliations in the version submitted for review.

{\bf Title}: Place the title centred at the top of the first page, in
a 15 pt bold font. (For a complete guide to font sizes and styles,
see Table~\ref{font-table}.) Long titles should be typed on two lines
without a blank line intervening. Approximately, put the title at 2.5
cm from the top of the page, followed by a blank line, then the
author's names(s), and the affiliation on the following line. Do not
use only initials for given names (middle initials are allowed). Do
not format surnames in all capitals (e.g., use ``Schlangen'' not
``SCHLANGEN'').  Do not format title and section headings in all
capitals as well except for proper names (such as ``BLEU'') that are
conventionally in all capitals.  The affiliation should contain the
author's complete address, and if possible, an electronic mail
address. Start the body of the first page 7.5 cm from the top of the
page.

The title, author names and addresses should be completely identical
to those entered to the electronical paper submission website in order
to maintain the consistency of author information among all
publications of the conference. If they are different, the publication
co-chairs may resolve the difference without consulting with you; so it
is in your own interest to double-check that the information is
consistent.

{\bf Abstract}: Type the abstract between addresses and main body.
The width of the abstract text should be
smaller than main body by about 0.6 cm on each side.
Centre the word {\bf Abstract} in a 12 pt bold
font above the body of the abstract. The abstract should be a concise
summary of the general thesis and conclusions of the paper. It should
be no longer than 200 words. The abstract text should be in 11 pt font.

{\bf Text}: Begin typing the main body of the text immediately after
the abstract, observing the single-column format as shown in 
the present document. Do not include page numbers.

{\bf Indent} when starting a new paragraph. Use 11 pt for text and 
subsection headings, 12 pt for section headings and 15 pt for
the title. 

{\bf Licence}: Include a licence statement as an unmarked (unnumbered)
footnote on the first page of the final, camera-ready paper.
See Section~\ref{licence} below for details and motivation.


\subsection{Sections}

{\bf Headings}: Type and label section and subsection headings in the
style shown on the present document.  Use numbered sections (Arabic
numerals) in order to facilitate cross references. Number subsections
with the section number and the subsection number separated by a dot,
in Arabic numerals. Do not number subsubsections.

{\bf Citations}: Citations within the text appear in parentheses
as~\cite{Gusfield:97} or, if the author's name appears in the text
itself, as Gusfield~\shortcite{Gusfield:97}.  Append lowercase letters
to the year in cases of ambiguity.  Treat double authors as
in~\cite{Aho:72}, but write as in~\cite{Chandra:81} when more than two
authors are involved. Collapse multiple citations as
in~\cite{Gusfield:97,Aho:72}. Also refrain from using full citations
as sentence constituents. We suggest that instead of
\begin{quote}
  ``\cite{Gusfield:97} showed that ...''
\end{quote}
you use
\begin{quote}
``Gusfield \shortcite{Gusfield:97}   showed that ...''
\end{quote}

If you are using the provided \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files, you
can use the command \verb|\newcite| to get ``author (year)'' citations.

As reviewing will be double-blind, the submitted version of the papers
should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,
self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g.,
\begin{quote}
``We previously showed \cite{Gusfield:97} ...''  
\end{quote}
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as 
\begin{quote}
``Gusfield \shortcite{Gusfield:97}
previously showed ... ''
\end{quote}

\textbf{Please do not use anonymous citations} and do not include
any of the following when submitting your paper for review:
acknowledgements, project names, grant numbers, and names or URLs of
resources or tools that have only been made publicly available in
the last 3 weeks or are about to be made public and would compromise the anonymity of the submission.
Papers that do not
conform to these requirements may be rejected without review.
These details can, however, be included in the camera-ready, final paper.

\textbf{References}: Gather the full set of references together under
the heading {\bf References}; place the section before any Appendices,
unless they contain references. Arrange the references alphabetically
by first author, rather than by order of occurrence in the text.
Provide as complete a citation as possible, using a consistent format,
such as the one for {\em Computational Linguistics\/} or the one in the 
{\em Publication Manual of the American 
Psychological Association\/}~\cite{APA:83}.  Use of full names for
authors rather than initials is preferred.  A list of abbreviations
for common computer science journals can be found in the ACM 
{\em Computing Reviews\/}~\cite{ACM:83}.

The \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files provided roughly fit the
American Psychological Association format, allowing regular citations, 
short citations and multiple citations as described above.

{\bf Appendices}: Appendices, if any, directly follow the text and the
references (but see above).  Letter them in sequence and provide an
informative title: {\bf Appendix A. Title of Appendix}.

\subsection{Footnotes}

{\bf Footnotes}: Put footnotes at the bottom of the page and use 9 pt
text. They may be numbered or referred to by asterisks or other
symbols.\footnote{This is how a footnote should appear.} Footnotes
should be separated from the text by a line.\footnote{Note the line
separating the footnotes from the text.}

\subsection{Graphics}

{\bf Illustrations}: Place figures, tables, and photographs in the
paper near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if
possible. 
Colour
illustrations are discouraged, unless you have verified that  
they will be understandable when printed in black ink.

{\bf Captions}: Provide a caption for every illustration; number each one
sequentially in the form:  ``Figure 1. Caption of the Figure.'' ``Table 1.
Caption of the Table.''  Type the captions of the figures and 
tables below the body, using 11 pt text.

Narrow graphics together with the single-column format may lead to
large empty spaces,
see for example the wide margins on both sides of Table~\ref{font-table}.
If you have multiple graphics with related content, it may be
preferable to combine them in one graphic.
You can identify the sub-graphics with sub-captions below the
sub-graphics numbered (a), (b), (c) etc.\ and using 9 pt text.
The \LaTeX{} packages wrapfig, subfig, subtable and/or subcaption
may be useful.
